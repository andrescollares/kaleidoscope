# LLVM+Haskell Kaleidoscope project

Based on 

Andrés Collares & Agustín Gazzano

## Requirements for working on the project

- `stack`
- `ghc-9.2.4`
- [`llvm-hs`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/llvm-hs)

## Linting and Formatting

- [`haskell-language-server`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
- [`ormolu`](https://github.com/tweag/ormolu)

## llvm-hs

> TODO: Check if building llvm-hs-15 from source is better than using stack or cabal, it could also open the possibility to make changes and bugfixes using a fork.

## Docker

> TODO: Should we create a docker image for an easier management of the working environment?
